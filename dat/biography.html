<p>
    I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley working in the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">RISE Lab</a>.
    I work on systems that power analytics over model training, and leverage hindsight.
    I am advised  by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>.
    I am fortunate to be a recipient of the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
