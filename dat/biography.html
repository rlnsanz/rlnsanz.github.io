<p>
    A Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley and aspiring professor,
    I have the privilege of conducting research at the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">RISE
        Lab</a>.
    My focus centers on <a href="/dat/MLOps_Interview_Study__CSCW24.pdf" target="_blank">experimentation in MLOps</a>,
    specifically exploring processes and tools that enable ML engineers to refine models and data within production or
    human-centric environments.
    This extensive work unifies themes from data systems, software engineering, and applied ML.

    I am the chief developer and maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/ucbrise/flor">FlorFlow</a>,
    a context-driven platform for streamlining AI/ML development and experimentation.
    Guided and mentored by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>,
    I have been honored to receive the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship,
    further supported by a generous grant from Dell Inc.
