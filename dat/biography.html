<p>
    I am a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Arizona State University's <a href="https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/"
        target="_blank">School of Computing and
        Augmented Intelligence</a>, where I extend my work on <strong>FlorDB</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/ucbrise/flor">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/mKENSkk3S4Y?si=tbCMGvg25KkBqHEy">YouTube</a>) into the realm of <strong>document intelligence</strong>, 
        building pipelines that log, query, and analyze document data with the same rigor as the machine learning lifecycle.
    Advised by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>, I completed my PhD in computer science at UC Berkeley, where I
    studied <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2024/EECS-2024-142.html" target="_blank">the
        management of context (or metadata) in the machine learning lifecycle</a>.    
    
        <!-- <br><br> -->

    My PhD was funded by a UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship,
    further supported by a generous grant from Dell Inc.
