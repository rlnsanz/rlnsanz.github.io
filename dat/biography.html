<p>
    I am an aspiring professor and a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley working
    in the <a href="https://epic.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">EPIC Data Lab</a> (formerly <a
        href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">RISE Lab</a>).
    I research <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09125.pdf" target="_blank">experimentation in MLOps</a>.
    Specifically, processes and tools for ML engineers to iterate on models and
    data in production, or people-facing environments.
    This work spans topics in data systems, software engineering, and applied ML.
    I'm the primary developer and maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/ucbrise/flor">PyFlor</a>,
    a record-replay system for <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p682-garcia.pdf" target="_blank">Hindsight
        Logging for
        Model Training</a> (VLDB '21).
    I am advised by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>, and am a fortunate
    recipient of UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
