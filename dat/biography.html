<p>
    I am an aspiring professor and a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley working in the <a
        href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">RISE Lab</a>.
    <!--     I work on systems that power analytics over model training, and leverage hindsight. -->
    I research <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09125.pdf" target="_blank">experimentation in MLOps</a>.
    Specifically, processes and tools for ML engineers to iterate on models and
    data with high velocity and low friction.
    This work spans topics in data systems, software engineering, and applied ML.
    I'm the primary developer and maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/ucbrise/flor">flor</a>,
    a record-replay system for hindsight logging & ML training (in Python). We wrote all about it
    in our latest paper <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p682-garcia.pdf" target="_blank">Hindsight Logging for
        Model Training</a>.
    I am advised by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>, and am a fortunate
    recipient of UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
