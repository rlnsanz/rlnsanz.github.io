<p>
    I am currently a first year Ph.D. student in computer science at UC Berkeley working in the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">RISE Lab</a>. 
    My research experience lies primarily in interactive visualization, and I am broadly interested in helping people understand and work effectively with data, and the processes that produce or consume it.
    Previously, I was an undergraduate research aide for the Visual Analytics and Data Exploration Research (<a href="http://vader.lab.asu.edu/" target="_blank">VADER</a>) Lab.
