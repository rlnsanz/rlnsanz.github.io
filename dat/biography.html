    I am currently a third year Ph.D. student in computer science at UC Berkeley working in the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">RISE Lab</a>.
    At Berkeley, my research has focused primarily on capturing and managing the context of data, code, and models in the machine learning lifecycle. This research spans topics in experiment reproducibility,
    data management, and model explainability. I am a recipient of UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
