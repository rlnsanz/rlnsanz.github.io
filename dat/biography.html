    I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley working in the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">RISE Lab</a>.
    I study optimistic software engineering and data management practices in machine learning, and
    am advised  by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>.
    I am fortunate to be a recipient of the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
