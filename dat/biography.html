<p>
    A Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley and aspiring professor,
    I have the privilege of conducting research at the <a href="https://epic.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">EPIC Data
        Lab</a>,
    formerly known as the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">RISE Lab</a>.
    My focus centers on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09125.pdf" target="_blank">experimentation in MLOps</a>,
    specifically exploring processes and tools that enable ML engineers to refine models and data within production or
    human-centric environments.
    This extensive work unifies themes from data systems, software engineering, and applied ML.

    I am the chief developer and maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/ucbrise/flor">FlorDB ðŸŒ»</a>
    a record-replay system tailored for <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p682-garcia.pdf"
        target="_blank">Hindsight Logging for Model Training</a> (VLDB '21).
    Guided and mentored by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>,
    I have been honored to receive the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship,
    further supported by a generous grant from Dell Inc.
