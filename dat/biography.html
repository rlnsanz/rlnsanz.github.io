<p>
    I am a Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley working in the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">RISE Lab</a>.
<!--     I work on systems that power analytics over model training, and leverage hindsight. -->
    I research logging, slating, and other record-keeping practices in agile and data-driven computing (e.g. machine learning) --
    check out our latest work on <a href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p682-garcia.pdf" target="_blank">Hindsight Logging for Model Training</a>.
    I am advised  by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>, and am a fortunate recipient of UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
