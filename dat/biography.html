<p>
    This summer 2024 I'll be starting as a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow
    at Arizona State University's <a href="https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/" target="_blank">Schoool of Computing and
        Augmented Intelligence</a>.
    I'm wrapping up my PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, where I've
    had the privilege of doing research at the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">RISE Lab</a> and
    <a href="https://epic.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">EPIC Data Lab</a>.
    Adviced by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>,
    my research has focused on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16795" target="_blank">experimentation in MLOps</a>
    and the management of context in the machine learning lifecycle.
    This work unifies themes from data systems, software engineering, and applied ML.
    I am the chief developer and maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/ucbrise/flor">FLOR</a> family of
    projects, a unified framework for managing <a
        href="https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2017/papers/p111-hellerstein-cidr17.pdf" target="_blank">the ABCs of
        Context</a> in <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Flor_CMI_18_CameraReady.pdf"
        target="_blank">the machine learning lifecycle</a>.
    I have been honored to receive the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship,
    further supported by a generous grant from Dell Inc.
