    I am a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Arizona State University's <a href="https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/"
        target="_blank">School of Computing and
        Augmented Intelligence</a>.
    I recently completed my PhD in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, where I
    studied <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2024/EECS-2024-142.html" target="_blank">the
        Management of Context in the Machine Learning Lifecycle</a>.
    Advised by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>,
    my research unifies themes from databases, software engineering, and applied ML.

    I am the chief developer and maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/ucbrise/flor">FlorDB</a>, a <a href="https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p682-garcia.pdf" target="_blank">hindsight logging</a>
    database for the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02498.pdf" target="_blank">machine learning lifecycle</a>.
    My PhD was funded by a UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship,
    further supported by a generous grant from Dell Inc.
