    I am a third year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley working in the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">RISE Lab</a>.
    I study context (i.e. metadata) management in the machine learning lifecycle, and am advised  by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>.
    We've recently published a new technique called hindsight logging that enables model developers to "query the past" for any bit of training execution data.
    I am a recipient of the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
