I am currently an undergraduate research
    aide at the Visual Analytics and Data Exploration
    Research (<a href="http://vader.lab.asu.edu/" target="_blank">VADER</a>) Lab at Arizona State University.
    I expect to graduate May 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science, and start my PhD in the Fall.
    I have been selected for honorable mention for  the Computing Research Association's
    (CRA) <a href="http://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/" target="_blank">Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award</a> (2017).

The overarching theme of my undergraduate research has been
    to create technologies to help people understand and work effectively with large sets of data.
    My research exprience lies primarily in Visual Analytics, and Machine Learning.
    My goal is to study data structures, such as graphs or information networks, for <b>fast machine learning at scale</b>.
    I have presented three posters and given two talks at national symposiums and an IEEE workshop.
    My research has been <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347639/?arnumber=7347639&tag=1" target="_blank">published</a> in
    the <em>Proceedings of the IEEE VAST Challenge Workshop</em>, and I have submitted two more journal publications on
    my most recent projects.
