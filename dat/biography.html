<p>
I am currently an incoming Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. I graduated May 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science from Arizona State University.
    At ASU, I was an undergraduate research aide for the Visual Analytics and Data Exploration
    Research (<a href="http://vader.lab.asu.edu/" target="_blank">VADER</a>) Lab, where I worked on tools to help people understand and work effectively with large sets of data.
    My research experience lies primarily in Visual Analytics and Machine Learning. I was fortunate enough to be awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship,
    and UC Berkeley's Chancellor's Fellowship for Graduate Study.
