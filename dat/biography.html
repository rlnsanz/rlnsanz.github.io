    I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley working in the <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">RISE Lab</a>.
    I work to help model developers learn from mistakes by leveraging context in natural and intuitive ways. I am advised  by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>.
    We've recently published a new technique called hindsight logging that enables model developers to "query the past" for any bit of training execution data.
    I am a recipient of the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
