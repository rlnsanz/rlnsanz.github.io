    I am a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Arizona State University's <a href="https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/"
        target="_blank">School of Computing and
        Augmented Intelligence</a>.
    I completed my PhD in computer science at UC Berkeley, where I
    studied <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2024/EECS-2024-142.html" target="_blank">the
        management of context (or metadata) in the machine learning lifecycle</a>.    
    Advised by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>,
    my research unifies themes from databases, software engineering, and applied ML.

    I am the chief developer and maintainer of <strong>FlorDB</strong>, a <a href="https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p682-garcia.pdf" target="_blank">hindsight logging</a>
    database for the <a href="https://www.vldb.org/cidrdb/papers/2025/p33-garcia.pdf" target="_blank">machine learning lifecycle</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ucbrise/flor">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/mKENSkk3S4Y?si=tbCMGvg25KkBqHEy">YouTube</a>).
    My PhD was funded by a UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship,
    further supported by a generous grant from Dell Inc.
