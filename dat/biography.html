<p>
I am currently an undergraduate research
    aide at the Visual Analytics and Data Exploration
    Research (<a href="http://vader.lab.asu.edu/" target="_blank">VADER</a>) Lab at Arizona State University.
    I will be graduating May 2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science, and will be starting my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley in the Fall.
The overarching theme of my undergraduate research has been
    to create tools to help people understand and work effectively with large sets of data.
    My research exprience lies primarily in Visual Analytics and Machine Learning. I was fortunate enough to be awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship,
    and UC Berkeley's Chancellor's Fellowship for Graduate Study.
