I am a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow at Arizona State University's <a href="https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence</a>, where I develop <a href="https://github.com/ucbrise/flor">FlorDB</a>&mdash;a hindsight logging database for managing context throughout the AI/ML lifecycle. FlorDB captures and orchestrates runtime values, code versions, and model checkpoints, enabling reproducible experiments and traceable workflows in applications ranging from document intelligence to robotics.

My PhD in computer science from UC Berkeley, advised by <a href="https://dsf.berkeley.edu/jmh/" target="_blank">Joe Hellerstein</a>, focused on <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2024/EECS-2024-142.html" target="_blank">the management of context and metadata in the machine learning lifecycle</a>. During my doctoral work, I collaborated with the <a href="https://www.nacdl.org/" target="_blank">NACDL</a> and a <a href="https://www.kqed.org/" target="_blank">local newsroom</a> to develop <em>scalable review systems</em> for analyzing large document archives&mdash;work that showed how computational tools can help organizations sift through vast collections to identify critical patterns. My PhD was supported by a UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship, an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and a one year grant from Dell Inc.

While FlorDB powers diverse AI/ML applications, I've particularly focused on document intelligence for legal applications at ASU. Working with the <a href="https://law.asu.edu">College of Law</a> and affiliated clinics, I build systems that help under-resourced legal teams manage overwhelming caseloads. This work involves developing computational tools in collaboration with their intended users that can query both facts and legal principles to surface critical insights from massive document collections. As legal and regulatory environments generate ever-growing archives of digital documents, these systems become essential infrastructure for access to justice and accountable governance.
